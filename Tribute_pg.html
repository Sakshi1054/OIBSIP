<h2>A brief summary of Kalpana Chawla</h2>
 <ul>  
<li><h3>Early life and education</h3></li>
<p>
    Kalpana Chawla was born on 17 March 1962 in Karnal, Haryana.She completed her schooling from Tagore Baal 
    Niketan Senior Secondary School, Karnal. She went to local flying clubs and watched planes with her father.
    After earning a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab Engineering College, 
    India, she moved to the United States in 1982 and obtained a Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering
    from the University of Texas at Arlington in 1984.Chawla went on to earn a second Master's in 1986 and a
    PhD in aerospace engineering in 1988 from the University of Colorado Boulder.
</p>
<li><h3>Career</h3></li>
<p>
    In 1988, Chawla began working at NASA Ames Research Center, where she did computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
    research on vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) concepts. Much of Chawla's research is 
    included in technical journals and conference papers. In 1993, she joined Overset Methods, Inc. as vice 
    president and Research Scientist specializing in simulation of moving multiple body problems. Chawla held 
    a Certified Flight Instructor rating for airplanes, gliders and Commercial Pilot licenses for single and
    multi-engine airplanes, seaplanes and gliders. After becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 1991, 
    Chawla applied for the NASA Astronaut Corps. She joined the corps in March 1995 and was selected for
    her first flight in 1997.
</p>
<li><h3>First space mission</h3></li>
<p>
    Her first space mission began on 19 November 1997, as part of the six-astronaut crew that flew the Space 
    Shuttle Columbia flight STS-87.She had traveled 10.67 million km, as many as 252 times around the Earth. 
    On her first mission, Chawla traveled 10.4/6.5 million miles in 252 orbits of the earth, logging more than
    376 hours (15 days and 16 hours) in space.
</p>
<li><h3>Second space mission and death</h3></li>
<p>
    In 2000, Chawla was selected for her second flight as part of the crew of STS-107.On 16 January 2003, Chawla 
    returned to space aboard Space Shuttle Columbia on the ill-fated STS-107 mission. The crew performed nearly 
    80 experiments studying Earth and space science, advanced technology development, and astronaut health and 
    safety.During the launch of STS-107, Columbia's 28th mission, a piece of foam insulation broke off from the
    Space Shuttle external tank and struck the port wing of the orbiter.<br>

    When Columbia re-entered the atmosphere of Earth, the damage allowed hot atmospheric gases to penetrate and
    destroy the internal wing structure, which caused the spacecraft to become unstable and break apart.<br>

    Chawla died on 1 February 2003, in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, along with the other six crew members, when
    Columbia disintegrated over Texas during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, shortly before it was scheduled
    to conclude its 28th mission, STS-107.Her remains were identified along with those of the rest of the 
    crew members and were cremated and scattered at Zion National Park in Utah in accordance with her wishes

<li><h3>Honours and recognition</h3></li>
<ol><p>
<li>The fourteenth contracted Northrop Grumman Cygnus spacecraft mission delivering supplies to the ISS was named
     the S.S. Kalpana Chawla after her.</li><br>
<li>Asteroid 51826 Kalpana Chawla, one of seven named after the Columbia's crew</li><br>
<li>74th Street in the "Little India" of Jackson Heights, Queens, New York City, New York, United States, has been
     renamed "Kalpana Chawla Way" in her honor.</li><br>  
<li>NASA has dedicated a supercomputer to Chawla.</li><br>  
<li>The Kalpana Chawla Outstanding Recent Alumni Award at the University of Colorado, given since 1983, was 
    renamed after Chawla.</li><br>
